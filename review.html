        Rawson Marshall Thurber’s “Red Notice” should work on paper. It’s got a charismatic cast sent globe-hopping to
        beautiful
        places on a treasure hunt straight out of an “Indiana Jones” movie. How could it go wrong? Well, for starters,
        Thurber
        and everyone involved forgot a little thing called personality. Rarely have I seen a movie that feels more
        processed by
        a machine, a product for a content algorithm instead of anything approaching artistic intent or even an honest
        desire to
        entertain. And while there have been quality blockbusters produced by the Hollywood machine for generations (I
        miss
        those days), it feels like we’re increasingly reaching the point where they are so calculated and programmed
        that the
        human element is completely drained from them, making them as disposable as a fast food cheeseburger. Worst of
        all, that
        “content” approach is pulling the life from stars who have shown so much of it in the past. When the poster
        for
        “Red
        Notice” was released, most people lamented its Photoshopped, bland nature. They didn’t realize how honestly it
        captured
        the movie.

        Thurber, the director of “Central Intelligence” and “Skyscraper” (two movies I enjoyed enough on their own
        terms, for
        the record), reunites with his muse, Dwayne Johnson, who plays the FBI’s top profiler John Hartley. The film
        opens with
        an awkwardly inserted info dump about three coveted eggs that were once the property of Cleopatra. Only two
        have
        been
        discovered, making the missing golden egg into a Holy Grail for treasure hunters, including one of the world’s
        most
        notorious criminals Nolan Booth (Ryan Reynolds). In the film’s relatively effective opening sequence, Hartley
        catches
        Booth trying to steal one of the eggs, inadvertently tying the two for the rest of the film into a classic
        buddy
        comedy
        dynamic—the muscle guy and the fast talker. They battle the authorities, a few bad guys, and another criminal
        mastermind
        nicknamed The Bishop (Gal Gadot) as they bounce around the world, trying to obtain all three eggs and sell
        them
        to the
        highest bidder.

        People have lamented the growing sensation that Netflix increasingly makes product that’s designed to be
        watched
        with a
        phone in your hand, and I’m not sure I’ve ever felt this more strongly than while watching “Red Notice.” Made
        for $200
        million, none of that fortune was spent on anything that retains a human touch—it’s the iPhone app of action
        movies.
        Look up and see a beautiful person in a beautiful place running or shooting something—go back to your phone.
        While there
        are some truly goofy and yet somehow predictable twists, there’s almost no real story here, certainly not a
        memorable
        one. And the settings, while often gorgeous, somehow lack personality too. Even the title sounds like
        something
        grabbed
        out of an Action Movie Screenwriter program.

        So much money, so much charm, so much movie, and yet it adds up to so very little. “Red Notice” is as
        disposable a
        movie
        as you’ll see this year, something that most Netflix subscribers will have trouble remembering exists weeks
        later.
        It
        sets up a potential franchise in its final scenes (because of course it does)—let’s hope everyone involved
        forgets
        about
        that too.
